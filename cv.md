### Briefly About Myself:

I've always dreamed of becoming a programmer. 
But I didn't have enough motivation to continue studying and not quit at the beginning. 
 so I started learning programming through game creation.
 Now I am studying the creation of games in such an engine as Unity.
 I like this process, but my goal is to learn how to create websites.
 I hope I finish my studies at RS and achieve my goal.

### Skills and Proficiency:

- unity
- C#
